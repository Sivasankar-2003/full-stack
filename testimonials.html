									<p class="m-n"><em>"Transfer and Rental Car from Siva
I arranged the transfer from VOLKSWAGEN  Airport to my accommodation and from the accommodation back to the airport, as well as renting a car for 3 weeks through Siva cars. Everything was 100% satisfactory. For the transfer, you're informed a day in advance where the driver will be waiting for you. They wait at the airport for 1 hour after landing, holding a sign with your last name, making them easy to find. As for the rental car, I booked a Hyundai i10 Grand Automatic and received exactly that. The car was delivered to my accommodation and picked up from there as well. It was one year old with 18,000 km on it. I drove 1500 km in the 3 weeks and everything went smoothly. The car was in great condition. I didn't even have to leave a deposit. I had ordered the car with all available insurances, so I was covered in case of any issues. Getting used to driving on the left side of the road takes some getting used to, so it's better to be fully insured. Cleaning the car, inside and out, cost me 300 Rupees, which is about RS 300. The cleaning is done by staff at a car wash and takes approximately 2.5 hours, including wait time. Just a heads up regarding the timing for returning the rental car. I can wholeheartedly recommend booking transfers and renting a car through siva cars. Also, I recommend the website www.volkswagen.com, which is how I found out about siva cars, for planning our holiday. Thank you very much."</em></p>
